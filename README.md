## Introduction
Welcome to our final project for CS 546, a website that allows users to review TV shows and find similar shows based on shows they already like!
## Setting Up the Project
1. To run our project, cd into the CS546-Final-Project directory.  
2. Then, ensuring that node is set up with np, run the `npm i` command.
3. Next, seed the database with shows, users, and reviews using the `npm run seed` command.
4. Finally, run the seeded project using the `npm start` command.
5. The website can be found at localhost:3000!
## How to Use Our Project
- Using our website is intuitive, the home page shows different options where you can search for a show, view the full list of all potential shows, or click the Don't Know What to Watch Menu? to find shows to watch!  
- Using the navigation bar at the top right of every page, the User can register for an account or log in to their existing account.
  - With an account, you can create, edit, and delete your own reviews for any TV show you would like, and you can save TV shows to a list of shows that you Want to Watch!
  - Your account information, including written reviews and saved shows, can be found on the User Account page, found in the navigation bar once you are logged in.
